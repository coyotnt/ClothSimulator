# ðŸ—‚Introduction

This is a GPU-based cloth simulator implemented by CUDA. The algorithm is based on [ARCSim](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/resources/ARCSim/).

### Changes
- Fnet force output per node output
    - NOTE: Allowing remeshing to generate more than 10k nodes can significantly slow down the performance
- Changed exporting to include obstacles.
- Introduced a new command line flag (--no-export-obstacles) to disable the export of obstacle data during simulations.
- Improved the naming convention for saved frame files, making it more intuitive and easier to manage.
- Adjusted the replay function to accommodate the new naming convention.

For example, I used this [plugin](https://github.com/neverhood311/Stop-motion-OBJ) to bring the OBJs into Blender 3.6.

# ðŸ›  Setup
### Dependencies

- OpenGL
- GLAD (already in lib directory)
- GLFW
- jsoncpp
- Eigen
- CUDA

Note: If you're using Windows, vspkg is recommended to install dependencies.

### Build

Run the following command in this directory:

```key
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make all
```

# ðŸ“‘ Usage

The simulator has 5 different modes. All the command mentioned should be run in this directory. Drop the --gpu parameter if you want CPU simulation.

### Simulate

Simulate and display according to a configuration file.

Note: Currently, the simulate mode is not working due to an OpenGL issue.

```key
./build/ClothSimulator simulate [config_file] --gpu
```

For example:

```key
./build/ClothSimulator simulate conf/sphere.json --gpu
```

### Simulate (Offline)

Similar to simulate mode, but will save cloth mesh for every frame to output directory. You can also disable obstacle data export with the '--no-export-obstacles' flag.

```key
./build/ClothSimulator simulate_offline [config_file] [output_dir] --gpu [--no-export-obstacles]
```

For example:

```key
./build/ClothSimulator simulate_offline conf/sphere.json output/sphere --gpu [--no-export-obstacles]
```

### Resume

Resume and display a halted offline simulation.

```key
./build/ClothSimulator resume [output_dir] --gpu
```

### Resume (Offline)

Similar to resume mode, but will save cloth mesh for every frame to output directory. You can also disable obstacle data export with the '--no-export-obstacles' flag.

```key
./build/ClothSimulator resume_offline [output_dir] --gpu [--no-export-obstacles]
```

### Replay

Replay simulation result according to a output directiry. This mode has no GPU mode.

```key
./build/ClothSimulator replay [output_dir]
```
